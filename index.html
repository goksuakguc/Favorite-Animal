            This is Booger. He is a 300 pound gorilla that was rescued from Africa. His parents were killed py poachers. His favorite food is grapes, he enjoys playing hide and seek, and gets along great with kids. You can adopt him for $1,000,000.

            Booger is great with sharing. He shares his boogers with his gorilla mates all the time. He even picks the flea off of the other gorillas without expecting them to pick the flea off of himself in return.

                Booger likes to learn new sign language words, is very smart and is currently looking for his soul-mate (which is probably Rachell the Hippo). He also likes Dubstep.
